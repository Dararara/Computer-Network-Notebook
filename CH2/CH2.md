Application architecture
client-server architecture: 
* there is an always-on host, called server, which services requests from many other hosts.
* Since one server may not enough, there are some data center.

Peer to peer architecture:
* the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers.
* One of the most compelling features of P2P is their self-scalability.
* However, P2P applications face challenges of security, performance, and reliability due to their highly decentralized structure.
