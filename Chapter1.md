## 1.1 Introduction
End system access the Internet through Internet Service Providers(ISPs), including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs...

* Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF). The IETF standards documents are called requests for comments(RFCs).
* End system attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.

## The network edge
Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line(DSL) and cable.
* DSL: A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company that provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its ISP.
